This directory contains 24 folders of the improved global paleogeographic maps during 402-2 Ma at present-day coordinates in shapefile format, a GPlates project file (.gproj), and two rotation files in the model of Matthews et al. (2016).

Each folder contains three or four shapefiles (i: ice sheet, m: mountain, lm: landmass and sm: shallow marine) at a time interval. Since they are at present-day coordinates, to reconstruct them in GPlates, please load them and the two rotation files in GPlates and reconstruct them to geological time. Note that, to avoid artefacts introduced from overlapping paleogeographies, the displaying order uses the following sequence: ice sheets, mountains, landmasses and finally shallow marine environments (top to bottom layering). 

The file (.gproj) is a GPlates project file. To load all of the shapefiles in the 24 folders and two rotation files in GPlates, please open the .gproj file in GPlates.

These two rotation files come from the plate motion model of Matthews et al. (2016). This model can be downloaded from the link (https://www.earthbyte.org/global-plate-models/). 

If you have any question about GPlates, please see the tutorials on GPlates website (https://www.gplates.org/).
